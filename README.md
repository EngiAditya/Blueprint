- **Spring**
- **Nut**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **CAD Software**: SolidWorks
- **Simulation Platform**: ANSYS Workbench
- **Analysis Types**:
  - Static Structural Analysis
  - Modal Analysis
  - Random Vibration Analysis

## üîç Analysis Summary

### 1. **Static Structural Analysis**
- Purpose: To assess stress distribution and deformation under static loading.
- Observations: Stress concentration near mounting ends and spring sections.
- Output: Total deformation and von Mises stress plots.

### 2. **Modal Analysis**
- Purpose: To identify the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes.
- Observations: First 6 modes extracted; helps understand vibration behavior.

### 3. **Random Vibration Analysis**
- Purpose: To simulate shock absorber response to random dynamic loading, such as road irregularities.
- Observations: Peak accelerations noted; verifies vibration endurance.
